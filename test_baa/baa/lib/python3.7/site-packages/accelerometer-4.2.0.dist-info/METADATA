A tool to extract meaningful health information from large accelerometer datasets. The software generates time-series and summary metrics useful for answering key questions such as how much time is spent in sleep, sedentary behaviour, or doing physical activity.

## Installation

```bash
pip install accelerometer
```

You also need Java 8 (1.8.0) or greater. Check with the following:

```bash
java -version
```

You can try the following to check if everything works properly:
```bash
# Create an isolated environment
$ mkdir test_baa/ ; cd test_baa/
$ python -m venv baa
$ source baa/bin/activate

# Install and test
$ pip install accelerometer
$ wget -P data/ http://gas.ndph.ox.ac.uk/aidend/accModels/sample.cwa.gz  # download a sample file
$ accProcess data/sample.cwa.gz
$ accPlot data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz
```


## Usage
To extract a summary of movement (average sample vector magnitude) and
(non)wear time from raw Axivity .CWA (or gzipped .cwa.gz) accelerometer files:

```bash
$ accProcess data/sample.cwa.gz

 <output written to data/sample-outputSummary.json>
 <time series output written to data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz>
```

The main JSON output will look like:
```json
{
    "file-name": "sample.cwa.gz",
    "file-startTime": "2014-05-07 13:29:50",
    "file-endTime": "2014-05-13 09:49:50",
    "acc-overall-avg(mg)": 32.78149,
    "wearTime-overall(days)": 5.8,
    "nonWearTime-overall(days)": 0.04,
    "quality-goodWearTime": 1
}
```

To visualise the time series and activity classification output:
```bash
$ accPlot data/sample-timeSeries.csv.gz
 <output plot written to data/sample-timeSeries-plot.png>
```

You can also import the underlying modules to use in your custom python scripts:
```Python
from accelerometer import summariseEpoch
summary = {}
epochData, labels = summariseEpoch.getActivitySummary(
    "sample-epoch.csv.gz",
    "sample-nonWear.csv.gz",
    summary)
# <nonWear file written to "sample-nonWear.csv.gz" and dict "summary" updated
# with outcomes>
```

## Under the hood
Interpreted levels of physical activity can vary, as many approaches can be
taken to extract summary physical activity information from raw accelerometer
data. To minimise error and bias, our tool uses published methods to calibrate,
resample, and summarise the accelerometer data. [Click here for detailed
information on the
data processing methods on our wiki.](https://biobankaccanalysis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html)
